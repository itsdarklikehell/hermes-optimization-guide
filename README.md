**Run [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) well: cheaper, faster, safer, and actually getting better over time.**

Hermes does a lot out of the box. The [official docs](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/) tell you everything it *can* do. This guide tells you what to *do*: which settings matter, what they cost, what breaks, and the fixes that have been confirmed to work. Where it says something costs 2,311 tokens, that number was measured on a real install.

> **Verified against Hermes Agent v0.21.4** (tag `v2026.9.21`, released 2026-09-21). Every command, flag, slash command, config key, and official-docs link in this repo is checked against that release by CI. Hermes ships fast; when it moves, the [drift guard](#how-this-guide-stays-accurate) opens an issue.

> **Coming from the 30-part v1 guide?** It has been rebuilt from scratch. The [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md#where-the-v1-parts-went) maps every old part to its new chapter, and the old files remain in git history.

## The ten changes that matter most

Each one is a few minutes' work. Together they cover most of the gap between a default install and a well-run one.

1. **Measure what every call costs.** `hermes prompt-size` shows the fixed prefix sent with *every* model call: about 13,000 tokens on a default install, three quarters of it tool schemas. → [05](./guide/05-token-budget.md#measure-before-you-cut)
2. **Move side tasks off your main model.** Compression, titles, approvals, and the background memory review all run on your *main* model by default (`auxiliary.*: auto`). Point them at a cheap one, but leave vision alone if your main model can see images. → [05](./guide/05-token-budget.md#lever-3-put-side-tasks-on-a-cheap-model)
3. **Drop toolsets you don't use, per platform.** Disabling `browser` and `tts` alone saves about 2,300 tokens on every call. → [05](./guide/05-token-budget.md#lever-1-send-fewer-tool-schemas)
4. **Protect the prompt cache.** Switching models mid-session re-reads the whole conversation at full price. Use `/btw`, `/bg`, or a subagent for side work instead. → [05](./guide/05-token-budget.md#lever-2-keep-the-prompt-cache-warm)
5. **Keep always-on instructions short.** A 32 KB `AGENTS.md` measured **+8,600 tokens per call**. → [06](./guide/06-personality-and-context.md)
6. **Lock down who can talk to your bot.** Use allowlists or DM pairing, and never allow everyone on an agent with a shell. → [10](./guide/10-messaging.md#access-control), [13](./guide/13-security.md#layer-1-who-can-talk-to-it)
7. **Run the gateway as a service.** Cron only fires while the gateway runs, and a user service dies at logout unless lingering is on. → [14](./guide/14-production.md#what-the-native-service-gives-you)
8. **Put subagents and cron jobs on cheaper models.** `delegation.model` and `cron.model`. → [05](./guide/05-token-budget.md#lever-6-cheaper-models-for-work-that-doesnt-need-the-best)
9. **Give local models 64K context, set on the server.** Hermes refuses anything smaller, and Ollama's default is far below that. → [04](./guide/04-local-models.md#the-64k-rule)
10. **Update deliberately.** `hermes update --check` and `--plan` first. Anything older than v0.21.2 should update for `state.db` safety. → [02](./guide/02-install.md#updating-without-breaking-things)

## How this guide stays accurate

Hermes ships several releases a month, and guides rot. This one is pinned to a single upstream release and checked against it mechanically:

- [`scripts/drift_guard.py`](./scripts/drift_guard.py) installs the pinned Hermes release, captures its real command tree, slash commands, config schema, and docs pages, and fails CI if the guide mentions anything that doesn't exist, from a `hermes` subcommand or flag to a config key, a toolset name, or a docs link and its `#anchor`.
- Numbers such as token counts and prompt sizes were measured on a real v0.21.4 install. The chapters say how, so you can reproduce them on yours.
- Fixes in [troubleshooting](./guide/15-troubleshooting.md) come from the official docs, merged upstream fixes, or release notes, each linked. Known-unsolved problems are listed as unsolved.
- A weekly job opens an issue when Hermes releases a version newer than the pin.

Run the check yourself:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch v2026.9.21 https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent.git /tmp/hermes-agent
python3 -m venv /tmp/venv && /tmp/venv/bin/pip install -e /tmp/hermes-agent pyyaml
/tmp/venv/bin/python scripts/drift_guard.py extract --upstream /tmp/hermes-agent --out /tmp/surface.json
/tmp/venv/bin/python scripts/drift_guard.py check --surface /tmp/surface.json
```

## Contributing

Corrections are the most valuable contribution: when Hermes changes and the guide is wrong, open an issue or a PR. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the (short) rules: verify against the pinned release, measure instead of guessing, and cite fixes.
